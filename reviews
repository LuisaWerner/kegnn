Future Experiments recommended in the reviews:
- Test with different sets of knowledge
- Test with other Base NN:  GraphSAGE+KENN, GIN+KENN, GAT+ KENN
- Take a look at OGB leaderboard and take baselines from there
- solve link prediction task with KENN
- Space complexity limited to unary OR unary OR binary, n-ary predicates? individual node degrees
- other graph sampling strategies
- hyperparameter tuning
- more infos on runs, resources used etc. (GPU graphs)
see paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07494.pdf for performance benchmarks etc. (analyzes on GPU memory usage etc., time per iteration etc. )
- Make some experiments with incomplete knowledge and delete links (see if KENN brings more improvement there)
- Datasets from mentioned paper above: YELP, FLICKR, REDDIt (already available in PyG), question: knowledge formulation
