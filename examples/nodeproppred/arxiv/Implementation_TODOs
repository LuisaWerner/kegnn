TODO
Implement Early Stopping
Explainer objects
Check CPU support
Check multiple GPU support (Python Lightning library)
Check other base NN
Check GNN Autoscale/Batching
Check other ogb datasets (eg. ogb Products)
Use Tensorboard/plots
Check if results are written correctly in files and interpreted with script
Speedup of KENN layers
Parallelize iterations (GPU)
Write the full training loop with base NN + KENN in one script
Test different knowledge
Check Weight initialization
log softmax or softmax ?
Other T-norm implementations
Choose another TBF function
