TODO
FUNCTIONAL
Explainer objects
Check GPU support
Check GNN Autoscale/Batching
Check other ogb datasets (eg. ogb Products)
Check if results are written correctly in files and interpreted with script
Speedup of KENN layers
Check Weight initialization
Write the full training loop with base NN + KENN in one script

NON-FUNCTIONAL
Check multiple GPU support (Python Lightning library)
Use Tensorboard/plots
Check directory structure (ogbn_products dataset etc.  are still in subdirectory of ogb-arxiv )

TESTS
Check other base NN
log softmax or softmax ?
Test different knowledge
log softmax or softmax ?
Other T-norm implementations
Choose another TBF function
