WHAT HAS DO BE DONE:
- Added datasets Flickr, Yelp, AmazonProducts, Reddit2
- Re-implemented GraphSAINT, ClusterGCN, GraphSAGE
- Re-implemented Sampling Pipeline: Each model has its own train sampling procedure now
- Enabled Edge Weights and Edge weight normalization "conf - normalize_edges"
- Linear and Logistic Regression Pipeline
- ToInductive() only removes edges between train, valid and test now, not nodes! Nodes are always referenced with masks
- GAT (Graph Attention Network) added as baseline

TODO
- Can we do Link Prediction?
- Set relations to trainable?
- What happens if we filter the links?
- Test with different sets of knowledge and mask links
- More info on resources: Memory consumption etc.
- Add more baselines: GAT,
